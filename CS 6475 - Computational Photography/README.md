## CS 6475 - Computational Photography

# Computational Photography Assignments

This repository contains all projects for Computational Photography. Due dates & course policies can be found in the course syllabus. 

## Assignments

- [Epsilon Photography](https://github.com/Jadams29/Georgia-Tech/tree/master/CS%206475%20-%20Computational%20Photography/assignments/A1-Epsilon_Photography)

The goal of this assignment is to experiment with *Epsilon Photography*, which is a technique for capturing multiple images of a scene -- each with a slight (i.e., "epsilon") variation of the camera parameters -- then fusing them to produce a novel image. Perhaps the most cited paper on the subject is ["Computational Photography: Epsilon to Coded Photography"](http://web.media.mit.edu/~raskar/Talks/ETCVparis08/raskarCompPhotoEpsilonCodedETVC08paper.pdf) (Raskar; 2009).
This assignment will also introduce and demonstrate the workflow for assignments using Canvas and Bonnie. Please follow the instructions carefully and ask questions on Piazza if you have any doubts!


- [Camera Obscura](https://github.com/Jadams29/Georgia-Tech/tree/master/CS%206475%20-%20Computational%20Photography/assignments/A2-Camera_Obscura)

The goal of this assignment is to learn about the operation of a camera by performing an experiment where you are _inside_ the camera yourself. Modern cameras -- including high-end DSLRs -- are simply more advanced versions of a camera obscura (also known as a pinhole camera). In this assignment, you will construct your own camera obscura and document the construction and operation of the camera. There is no coding for this assignment, and so the submission will consist purely of submitting the PDF file with your write-up.


- [Pyramid Blending](https://github.com/Jadams29/Georgia-Tech/tree/master/CS%206475%20-%20Computational%20Photography/assignments/A3-Blending)

In this assignment, you will be putting together a pyramid blending pipeline that will allow you to combine separate images into a seamlessly blended image. The technique is based on the paper [“A multiresolution spline with application to image mosaics”](http://persci.mit.edu/pub_pdfs/spline83.pdf) (Burt and Adelson; ACM 1983)


- [Panoramas](https://github.com/Jadams29/Georgia-Tech/tree/master/CS%206475%20-%20Computational%20Photography/assignments/A4-Panoramas)

In this project you will put together a pipeline to align and stitch panoramas from image sequences. See the paper ["Recognizing Panoramas"](http://matthewalunbrown.com/papers/iccv2003.pdf). (Brown and Lowe; 2003)


- [High Dynamic Range Photography](https://github.com/Jadams29/Georgia-Tech/tree/master/CS%206475%20-%20Computational%20Photography/assignments/A5-HDR)

In this homework assignment, we will focus on the core algorithms behind computing HDR images based on the paper [“Recovering High Dynamic Range Radiance Maps from Photographs”](http://www.pauldebevec.com/Research/HDR/debevec-siggraph97.pdf). (Debevec & Malik; SIGGRAPH 1997)


- [Video Textures](https://github.com/Jadams29/Georgia-Tech/tree/master/CS%206475%20-%20Computational%20Photography/assignments/A6-Video_Textures)

In this assignment we will be applying our computational photography magic to video, with the purpose of creating video textures, or infinitely looping pieces of video. These are basically gifs with very smooth transtitions, as seen in Udacity CP Lecture 06-02, Video Textures. The process is also described in [Video Textures](http://cs.colby.edu/courses/F07/cs397/papers/schodl-videoTextures-sig00.pdf). (Scholdl, et al; SIGGRAPH 2000)


## Projects

- [Research Replication Project](https://github.com/Jadams29/Georgia-Tech/tree/master/CS%206475%20-%20Computational%20Photography/assignments/MT-Research_Project)

The goal of this project is to independently replicate the results of a previously published computational photography paper.


- [Final Project](https://github.com/Jadams29/Georgia-Tech/tree/master/CS%206475%20-%20Computational%20Photography/assignments/Final_Project)

The goal of this project is to scope and complete a project on a topic in computational photography of your own choosing. 


- [Portfolio](https://github.com/Jadams29/Georgia-Tech/tree/master/CS%206475%20-%20Computational%20Photography/assignments/Portfolio)

The final portfolio showcases your work over the course of the semester to demonstrate what you learned and the results you achieved.
