# Image Frequency Spectra

This exercise focuses on images in the frequency domain.

## Running the Notebook

Follow the [instructions](../README.md#Setup) for installing Anaconda and creating the CP environment. 

You can start the notebook server by executing `jupyter notebook` from the terminal. Copy the URL shown in the terminal into the address bar of a web browser to reach the notebook explorer which can be used to navigate to one of the notebook files (i.e., a file ending in ".ipynb").

You can edit code in any cell of the notebook, and execute each cell by clicking the "play" icon on the menu bar, or using the "shift + enter" keyboard shortcut. The output of each cell will appear inline in the notebook immediately after each cell.

To run the animations, you may need the ffmeg package.  Install it into your CompPhoto environment by first activating and then invoking the install command:

```conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg```
