    "# CS6475: Image Frequency Spectra\n",
    "---\n",
    "This notebook follows the lectures in Module 4 dealing with frequency domain transforms of images. In many cases (as in the Blending project) there are clear analogues between operations in the frequency and spatial domains, but operating in the frequency domain also affords some unique opportunities. The walkthrough portion illustrates some practical issues that arise out of convention or implementation choices in the Numpy fft module, then proceeds to produce frequency spectra from images. \n",

    "You should complete Parts 1-3 by reading through the notebook and executing each code cell (you can use the keyboard shortcut `shift + enter` to execute cells). The last last section of the notebook contains a series of challenge problems that ask you to apply & extend these concepts. There are no required deliverables for this exercise, but you are encouraged to complete & discuss the material & challenge problems on the course forum.

    "\n",
    "For discrete signals, we use the [Discrete Fourier Transform [DFT]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform) (which is analogous to the Fourier Transform used on continuous signals). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since a single sine wave has only one frequency component, the DFT should only have one amplitude corresponding to the frequency of the sine wave. (It will also have one component corresponding to the average value of the signal if it is non-zero). Recall that the frequency components are represented with complex numbers, where the real parts correspond to the amplitude of **cosine** wave components of the signal, and the imaginary parts correspond to the amplitude of **sine** wave components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our input is a pure sine wave, we expect the real part of the amplitude to be zero. (Try experimenting with different phase offset, frequency, amplitude, and dc_signal values to see how they affect the DFT.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that while we said there should only be _one_ frequency component from our input signal, there are two peaks for each frequency in the output. That's because each pair of peaks represent the same frequency as a result of symmetry; the imaginary part will always be flipped over the x axis (because sin(x) = -sin(-x)) and the real part will always be mirrored across the y axis (because cos(x) = cos(-x)). As a result, the DFT of a signal or image contains half as many frequencies as there are cycles in the signal; the highest frequency term in the DFT is known as the [Nyquist frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can experiment with the parameters of the signal to explore the effects on the DFT. The code below also contains an example for animating the graph in the notebook; you can modify it to animate the results of changing any of the parameters."

Since the 2-D DFT is just taking the DFT of each row & column, these signals are exactly what the DFT will encode in the spectrum.\n",

These lines appear because the DFT implicitly assumes that the input image is a finite sample from an infinite repeated signal (i.e., it acts as though the input image is tiled repeatedly in every direction).
