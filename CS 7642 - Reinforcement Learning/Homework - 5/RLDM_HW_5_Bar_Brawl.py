# ## Description
# 
# You are the proprietor of an establishment that sells beverages of an unspecified, but delicious, nature. The establishment is frequented by a set $P$ of patrons.  One of the patrons is the instigator and another is the peacemaker.
# 
# On any given evening, a subset $S \subseteq P$ is present at the establishment. If the instigator is in $S$ but the peacemaker is not in $S$, then a fight will break out. If the instigator is not in $S$ or if the peacemaker is in $S$, then no fight will occur.
# 
# Your goal is to learn to predict whether a fight will break out among the subset of
# patrons present on a given evening, without initially knowing the identity of
# the instigator or the peacemaker.
# 
# ## Procedure
# 
# Develop a KWIK learner for this problem (see Li, Littman, and Walsh 2008).  Your learner will be presented with $S$, the patrons at the establishment, and the outcome (fight or no fight) of that evening.
# Your learner will attempt to predict whether a fight will break out, or indicate that
# it doesn't know, and should be capable of learning from the true outcome for the evening.
# 
# For each problem, the following input will be given:
# 
# -   `at_establishment`: a Boolean two-dimensional array whose rows
#     represent distinct evenings and whose columns represent distinct patrons.
#     Each entry specifies if a particular patron is present
#     at the establishment on a particular evening:
#     a $1$ means present and a $0$ means absent.
#     
# -   `fight_occurred`: a Boolean vector whose entries are the 
#     outcomes (a $1$ means ``FIGHT`` and a $0$ means ``NO FIGHT``) for that
#     particular evening.
# 
# 
# Specifically:
# 
# -   For each episode (evening), you should present your learner with the next row of `at_establishment` and the corresponding row of `fight_occurred`.
# -   If your learner returns a $1$ (for ``FIGHT``) or a $0$ (for ``NO FIGHT``),
#     you may continue on to the next episode.
# -   If your learner returns a $2$ (for ``I DONâ€™T KNOW``), then you should
#     present the pair (`at_establishment`, `fight_occurred`) to you learner
#     to learn from.
# 
# You will return a string of integers corresponding to the returned values of each episode.
# 
# The test case will be considered successful if no wrong answers are returned
# **and** the number of "I DON'T KNOW"s does not exceed the maximum 
# allowed by the autograder.
# 
# ## Resources
# 
# The concepts explored in this homework are covered by:
# 
# -   'Knows what it knows: A framework for self-aware learning', Li, Littman, Walsh 2008
# 
# ## Submission
# 
# -   The due date is indicated on the Canvas page for this assignment.
#     Make sure you have your timezone in Canvas set to ensure the
#     deadline is accurate.
# 
# -   Submit your finished notebook on Gradescope. Your grade is based on
#     a set of hidden test cases. You will have unlimited submissions.
#     By default, the last score is kept.  You can also set a particular
#     submission as active in the submission history, in which case that
#     submission will determine your grade.
# 
# -   Use the template below to implement your code. We have also provided
#     some test cases for you. If your code passes the given test cases,
#     it will run (though possibly not pass all the tests) on Gradescope.
# 
# -   Gradescope is using *python 3.6.x* and *numpy==1.18.0*, and you can
#     use any core library (i.e., anything in the Python standard library).
#     No other library can be used.  Also, make sure the name of your
#     notebook matches the name of the provided notebook.  Gradescope times
#     out after 10 minutes.
